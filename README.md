# TDAmeritradeTradingBot
Trading bot that executes trades using the TD Ameritrade API using an algorithm described here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9Bmxylp63Y&amp;ab_channel=CriticalTrading. Feel free to copy this repository and replace the algorithm with what ever you prefer instead!

I used Jupyter Notebook to develo this because of how nicely it presents data tables. You must create a TD Developer Account inorder to have access to the API. The script is still in development and only works when you run it when the market is open.
